'''
Requirement:
Our next PyGame code needs to add some animation.
Let's add a bouncing ball to the PyGame screen. And we make the ball keep on bouncing and never stop.
'''

import pygame

'''

v = gt
g = 9.8m/s^2

For free fall ball, when t0 = 0s, v0 = 0m/s
                    when t1 = 1s, v1 = 9.8m/s 
                    when t2 = 2s, v1 = 9.8 * 2 = 19.6m/s 

Here v means, velocity on y axis -> Vy.
For Vx, velocity on x axis, as there is no force on the x axis direction, Vx keeps unchanged.

Because our FPS is 100, our time unit is 0.01s
Because our distance unit is pixel, so we have to convert meter to pixel.

The ball initial velocity - [1,0]
means Vx = 1 pixel / 0.01s
      Vy = 0 pixel / 0.01s

height of my screen is about 20cm, 1080pixel
-> 5400 pixel = 100cm
-> 5400 pixel = 1m 


g=9.8m/s^2
 =9.8 * 5400 pixel / (100 * 0.01)s^2 
 =5.292 pixel / (0.01s)^2
 =5 pixel / (0.01s)^2
 
This means 
1st frame -> Vy = 0 pixel/0.01s
2nd frame (0.01s later) -> Vy = 5 pixel/0.01s
3rd frame (0.01s later) -> Vy = 10 pixel/0.01s
...

        A) If you have a surface, you simply call surface.get_rect(), you will get a new rectangle
