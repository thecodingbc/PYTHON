Q) Someone owes you $23.69 and gives you a hundred-dollar bill. How will you give him the changes?
'''

denomination = [0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50]

owed = 76.31
payed = []

# Step 1) sort the option list
denomination.sort(reverse=True)

# Step 2) try all the notes / coins 1 by 1
for d in denomination:
    while owed >= d:
        owed -= d
        payed.append(d)

# Step 3) print the result
print(sum(payed))
print(payed)

greedy algo doesn't always give you correct answer. 
coins = [1,4,5]
owed = 8
greedy payed = [5,1,1,1]
dp payed = [4,4]
