# What is memory address?
# 1 memory card is like a city.
# 1 byte is a family.
# each byte has an address, Just like your family has an address.
# Memory address points to some byte, or the beginning of several bytes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------

# The variable is a pointer, it points to a box.
# Depends on the variable type and value, it takes up different size of bytes.
# id() function: return the variable's box first byte memory address.

a = [1,2,3]
print(id(a))

b = [4,5,6]
print(id(b))

print(" -------------------------------- ")
b = a
print(id(b))

# Value Equality
print('a == b     :', a == b) # True

# Identity Equality
print('a is b     :', a is b) # True

print(" -------------------------------- ")

c = [1,2,3]
print(id(c))
print('a == c    :', a == c) # True
print('a is c    :', a is c) # False

print(" -------------------------------- ")

x = 10
print(id(x))
x += 2
print(id(x))
print(" -------------------------------- ")
