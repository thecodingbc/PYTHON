Requirement:

A juice factory produces apple juice and orange juice in 2 containers - cube size and ball size
cube container has a edge length 10cm
ball container has a radius 6 cm

The factory use 2 materials - plastic / metal
So in total, the factory produces 8 kinds of beverage:
1) apple juice - cube container - plastic material
2) apple juice - cube container - metal material
3) apple juice - ball container - plastic material
4) apple juice - ball container - metal material
5) orange juice - cube container - plastic material
6) orange juice - cube container - metal material
7) orange juice - ball container - plastic material
8) orange juice - ball container - metal material

orange juice cost: 0.14 cent / cm^3
apple juice cost: 0.11 cent / cm^3
plastic material cost: 0.08 cent / cm^2
metal material cost: 0.18 cent / cm^2



These 8 kinds of juice are sold in NTUC supermarket and Cold Storage supermarket.
NTUC charges 10% of your juice price, meaning if your juice is sold at $2, you need to pay NTUC 20 cent.
Cold Storage changes 15% of your juice price, meaning if your juice is sold at $2, you need to pay Code Storage 30 cent.

There are in total 16 situations.

Remember: the factory also needs to make profit 30%

The factory manager asks you to help them to calculate the price for the above 16 situations, how much they should sell for each case.

import math

-------------------------------------
Step 1) Prepare all the data including
-------------------------------------

a) container
b) juice
c) material
d) supermarket

'''

container_1 = ['cube', 10]   # cube has a edge length 10 cm
container_2 = ['sphere', 6]  # sphere has a radius 6 cm
containers = [container_1, container_2]

juice_1 = ['orange', 0.14] # juice cost: 0.14 cent / cm^3
juice_2 = ['apple', 0.11] # juice cost: 0.11 cent / cm^3
juice = [juice_1, juice_2]

material_1 = ['plastic', 0.08] # container material cost: 0.08 cent / cm^2
material_2 = ['metal', 0.18] # container material cost: 0.18 cent / cm^2
material = [material_1, material_2]

ntuc = ['NTUC', 0.1] # NTUC charges 10% of your juice price
cold_storage = ['Cold Storage', 0.15] # Cold Storage charges 15% of your juice price
supermarkets = [ntuc, cold_storage]

# IMPORTANCE !!! --------------------------------------------------------
# List is good thing, it helps to group all related information together

Step 2) Core Logic:
-------------------------------------

Conclusion 1) 
Total situation = 2 juice * 2 container * material * 2 supermarket
                = 16 situations
                
I use nested loop to cover all 16 situations

for container in containers: 
    for current_juice in juice:
        for current_material in material:
            for supermarket in supermarkets:
                # here, we have 4 variables: container / current_juice / current_material / supermarket
                # my core logic is here
                
Conclusion 2)                                 
Inside the loop body, what shall we do? 
Step 1) Calculate the container's surface and volume.
        So we define a function:
        def surface_and_volume(container):
            pass

Step 2) Use container's surface and volume / juice / material to calculate the cost of the juice to the factory
       So we define a function:
       def calculate_cost(container_data, juice, material):
           pass            
           
Step 3) Because the factory needs to make 30% profit, so based on the cost to the factory, we can calculate the price so the supermarket.
      So we define a function:
      def sold_price_to_supermarket(cost):
         pass
         
Step 4) Because NTUC and Cold Storage need to make profit, so same import price from factory has a different selling price to customer。
     So we define a function:
     def sold_price_to_customer(cost, supermarket):
        pass
