'''
find the value of s
s = a + aa + aaa + aaaa + aa...aï¼Œ
a can be any number from 1 to 9
term count comes from user input in console.

For example:
Enter the base number: 2
Enter the term count: 5
The answer is 24690

Explanation:
2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 is 24690
'''

#Observation
# term 0 - 5
# term 1 - 55 = 5 * 10 + 5
# term 2 - 555 = 5 * (5 * 10 + 5) + 5
# term 3 - 5555 = 5 * (5 * (5 * 10 + 5) + 5) + 5

#Summary
# term 0 = Loop 0 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 1 = Loop 1 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 2 = Loop 2 times [* 10 + 5]
# term 3 = Loop 3 times [* 10 + 5]

Question:
How many times the calculate (line 35) will be executed?
Let's say, in total we have n terms.
Answer: 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n
      = (1 + n) * n / 2
      = 1/2 * n^2 + 1/2 * n
      
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity means: how code slows as data grows
Time Complexity answer this question: how much slower the code will go if you give it ten times more data.
We use Big-O to express this.

When n = 10;  it calculate = 1/2 * 10 * 10     + 1/2 * 10   = 50    + 5  = 55   times      
When n = 100; it calculate = 1/2 * 100 * 100   + 1/2 * 100  = 5000  + 50 = 5050 times - when data grows 10 times, roughly, code slows 100 times.      
The driven factor is n^2, (1/2 * n) can be ignored.
So we say: Big-O(n^2)

O(1)
O(n)
O(n^2)

Question:
How many times the calculate (line 35) will be executed?
Let's say, in total we have n terms.
Answer: n - 1
Time Complexity: O(n)
-------------------------------------------------
When n = 10; it calculates 10 - 1 = 9 times
When n = 100; it calculates 100 - 1 = 99 times  - when data grows 10 times, roughly, code slows 10 times.
The driving factor is n, -1 can be ignore.
So we say: Big-O(n)
