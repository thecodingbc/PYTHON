    # Step 1) Populate all the dictionaries we prepared in our previous lessons -----------------
    populate_line_to_transit_station_dict()
    populate_change_lines_possibilities_dict()

    # Step 2) As each station can possibly be on more than 1 line.
    # So we have to use nested loop to see all the start_line and end_line combinations possibilities

    # For example, when passenger travels from 'Bishan' which is on red_line and yellow_line
    #                                       to 'Little India' which is on purple_line and blue_line
    # You can say, the passenger travels from
    # 1) red_line to purple_line
    # 2) red_line to blue_line
    # 3) yellow_line to purple_line
    # 4) yellow_line to blue_line
    # For each situation above, change_line_possibilities_dict (calculated in 0214) can tell you all the change line possibilities
    # We need to check one by one
