# IMPORTANCE!!! -----------------------------------
# What is recursive algorithm?
# a function calls itself to resolve the problem.
#
# 2 important points:
# 1) base case
# 2) recursive call
#
# Summary:
# 1) Recursion is convert the problem into a smaller scale sub-problem.
# For example: factorial(n) is converted to n * factorial(n-1)
# 2) And this conversion to a smaller scale sub-problem is non-stop, until we know the answer of the smallest problem.
